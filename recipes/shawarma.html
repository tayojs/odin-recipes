        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Levantine region 
            during the Ottoman Empire, consisting of meat that is cut into 
            thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slow-turning 
            vertical spit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken, 
            turkey meat, beef, falafel or veal.[6][7][1] The surface of the rotisserie 
            meat is routinely shaved off once it cooks and is ready to be served
